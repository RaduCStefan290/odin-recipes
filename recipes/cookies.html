    <div class="paragraphs">
         <p>The best recipe for double chocolate chip cookies must obviously include extra doses of cho edges, and oodles of melty chocolate chips in each glorious bite.</p>
         <p>It’s the chocolate dough recipe I’ve been making for years, stuffed with peanut butter cups. There’s no reason to stray from this basic chocolate dough!</p>
    </div>
    <h3 class="headers">Ingredients</h3>
    <div class="lists">
    <ul>
        <li>Chocolate chips</li>
        <li>Wet ingredients: Butter, white & brown sugars, egg, vanilla extract, and milk</li>
        <li>Dry ingredients: Flour, unsweetened natural cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <h4 class="headers">Steps</h4>
    <div class="lists">
    <ol>
        <li>Cream the butter and both sugars together before adding the egg and vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Separately, whisk the dry ingredients together and don’t be concerned about how little flour this recipe requires. (Remember that cocoa powder is another dry ingredient to bulk up the dough.)</li>
        <li>Combine wet and dry ingredients, then beat in the milk and then the chocolate chips</li>
        <li>Ensure you use proper room temperature butter, which should still be cool to the touch at about 65°F (18°C). If it’s too cold, it cannot cream and if it’s melty in the slightest, your cookies will be a mess.</li>
        <li>The dough definitely comes together easily, but it’s sticky and tacky as a result of the cocoa powder mixing with liquid</li>
        <li>Therefore, the dough requires chilling before you can shape and bake, I recommend at least 3 hours in the refrigerator</li>
        <li>Use a cookie scoop to help you portion the sticky dough</li>
        <li>After scooping the dough, shape it as best you can into tall column-like balls</li>
        <li>The cookies take at least 11 minutes to bake</li>
    </ol>
