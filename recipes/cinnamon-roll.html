    <div class="paragraphs">
    <p>Nothing kicks off a holiday celebration quite like waking up to the smell of cinnamon rolls wafting from the oven, especially when I don't have to lift a finger that morning except to preheat the oven.</p>
    <p>That's the magic of this recipe for overnight cinnamon rolls, which ensures all the heavy lifting is knocked out a day (or even weeks) in advance. Even better, it's a one-bowl recipe, so I don't need to dirty every dish in the house just to make a special breakfast.</p>

    <h3 class="headers">Ingredients</h3>
    <div class="lists">
    <ul>
        <li>Cinnamon</li>
        <li>Yeast</li>
        <li>Flour: Flour provides the dough structure. All-purpose flour is best for these cinnamon rolls. You could also use bread flour—the rolls will be chewier.</li>
        <li>Sugar: You need white granulated sugar in the dough, both for flavor and to feed the yeast.</li>
        <li>Salt: Flavor.</li>
        <li>Whole milk: Whole milk is ideal for the richest-tasting cinnamon rolls. Buttermilk works just as well without any changes to the recipe. Many readers have successfully substituted nondairy milks. In a pinch, you can use low-fat milk, but avoid using nonfat milk.</li>
        <li>Butter: This is a rich dough, meaning it has fat to help guarantee softness.</li>
        <li>Egg: Like butter, egg promises a softer, richer dough</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="headers">Steps</h4>
    <div class="lists">
    <ol>
        <li>Gather Ingredients. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Brush an 8-inch square baking dish with 1 tablespoon of the melted butter.</li>   
        <li>To make the dough: Whisk flour, white sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Work 3 tablespoons softened butter into flour mixture using your hands until butter is lentil-sized.</li>
        <li>Pour milk into flour-butter mixture and stir with a rubber spatula until a soft dough forms.</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a well-floured work surface and roll dough into a 10- x 10-inch square. Brush surface of dough with remaining 2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
        <li>To make the filling: Whisk ¼ cup white sugar, brown sugar, and cinnamon together in a small bowl. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon cinnamon-sugar mixture in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle remaining cinnamon sugar over butter-brushed dough.</li>
        <li>Roll dough around filling to form a log; cut log into 9 rolls about 1-inch wide; place rolls, cut-side up, in the prepared baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until rolls are puffed and lightly golden, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>To make the frosting: Beat confectioners' sugar, cream cheese, 1/4 cup softened butter, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until frosting is smooth.</li>
        <li>Top hot cinnamon rolls with cream cheese frosting.</li>
